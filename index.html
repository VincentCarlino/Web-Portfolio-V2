            Hi!  My name is Vincent Carlino.  I'm a second-year student at Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Music Recording.  I have skills and experience with programming in Java, HTML, CSS, C++, and I am currently teaching myself JavaScript and React Native.  I enjoy computer science because I enjoy solving logical problems and being able to understand how things work below the surface.</p> 
            <p> I enjoy back-end development because it allows me to have full control over how a program functions for a user.  Additionally, I really enjoy web development and user-interface design.  I believe that the visual design of a program is just as important as its functionality and I love customizing my user experience in a program so that it is both nice to look at and does what it needs to do. </p>

      <h3>Music Editor</h3>
      <h4> In my Object-Oriented Programming class, a classmate and I were responsible for constructing and implementing a music editor in Java as our final project.  The editor is able to read from text files to contruct songs (using the builder pattern) and has a variety of standard features such as the ability to add and remove notes from the piece as well as pause/play functionality.  This project was used to test our knowledge and understanding of a variety of OOP design patterns.  It utilizes the Java Swing graphics library for the user interface.     </h4>

      <h3>Project Pedometer</h3>
      <h4> Project Pedometer is a mobile game that I am currently co-developing with 3 other programmers from my home town.  The game is planned to play like a turn-based RPG that utilizes the pedometer in the mobile device to track and accumulate currency that is used to perform actions in-game. The project is being used as a learning experience by my team to get familiar with programming in React Native. </h4>

      <h3>My Startpage</h3>
        <h4>Startpages are simple HTML files that typically list your most frequently used sites and services.  There is an abundance of startpage templates online that users can tweak to meet their needs.  I constructed <a href="startpage/template.html" target="_blank"> my own startpage </a> with functional dropdown menus and a night-mode button. This project acted as my introduction to web-design and HTML/CSS.  I loved the process of creating this startpage and I'm still looking to improve its design and functionality.    </h4>
